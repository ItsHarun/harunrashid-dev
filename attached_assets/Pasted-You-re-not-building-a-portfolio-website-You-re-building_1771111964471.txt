You’re not building a “portfolio website.”
You’re building **digital mythology** around the founder of Kue.

This isn’t about listing projects.
This is about positioning.

Let’s design it intentionally.

---

# 1️⃣ First: Decide Your Archetype

Before structure, define the character.

Not “Senior Software Engineer at Nova.”
That’s LinkedIn.

Ask yourself:

* Are you the **systems thinker**?
* The **quiet builder**?
* The **AI realist**?
* The **anti-hype founder**?
* The **engineering philosopher**?

Kue is product-first and AI-forward. So your presence should feel:

> Minimal. Intentional. Thought-driven. Not loud.

You want depth, not noise.

---

# 2️⃣ Structure: Not a Portfolio — A Manifesto Hub

Here’s a powerful structure.

---

## 🧠 1. Landing Page = Philosophy

No “Hi, I’m Harun.”

Instead:

Big statement.

> “I build systems that outlive trends.”
> “Software should think before it speaks.”
> “AI is not magic. It’s architecture.”

Minimal text.
Dark theme.
Elegant typography.

Then a small line:

> Harun Rashid
> Builder of Kue.

No fluff.

---

## 🔥 2. “Thinking” Section (Not Blog)

Don’t call it Blog.

Call it:

* “Principles”

This is where you publish:

* Deep engineering essays
* AI takes (no hype)
* Product philosophy
* Mistakes you made
* Lessons from building Kue

This builds authority.

People don’t follow resumes.
They follow thinking.

---

## 🏗 3. “Kue” as a Living Case Study

Instead of listing projects:

Create one evolving page:

### “Building Kue”

Inside:

* Why Kue exists
* Architectural decisions
* Rejected ideas
* System design evolution
* Screenshots of iterations
* Tradeoffs you made

Make it transparent. Raw. Real.

This positions you as a serious builder.

---

## 🧩 4. “Beliefs”

This is powerful.

Create a page called:

> Beliefs

Short statements like:

* Most startups fail because they copy.
* AI products fail because they lack systems thinking.
* Simplicity is seniority.
* Engineers should understand business.

No explanations.
Just strong positions.

Controversial? Slightly.
Memorable? Absolutely.

---

## 🧬 5. “Now” Page

This is elite-tier positioning.

A single page titled:

> Now

And it updates regularly.

Example:

* Building Kue v2 architecture.
* Studying multi-agent AI systems.
* Thinking about notification intelligence at scale.
* Reading X.
* Exploring Y.

It makes you feel alive, not archived.

---

# 3️⃣ Design Philosophy

Your site should feel:

* Minimal
* Almost empty
* High whitespace
* No animations circus
* No skill bars
* No “HTML 90%”

Think:

* Monospace touches
* Black + off-white
* Sharp typography
* Quiet confidence

People should feel:

> This guy doesn’t chase trends. He builds systems.

---


You are not trying to get freelance gigs.

You are building founder gravity.

---

# 5️⃣ Advanced Move (Optional but Powerful)

Add a hidden layer.

Example:

Press `K` → opens a command palette
Type “manifesto” → navigates
Type “principles” → loads beliefs

Make it feel like an operating system.

This subconsciously says:

> Engineer first. Designer second.

Let user know that at the right place

---

# 6️⃣ Long-Term Strategy

Right now:

* Few visitors.

When Kue grows:

* Investors will read it.
* Engineers will read it.
* Product people will read it.
* Curious users will Google you.

Your site must answer:

> “Why should I trust this guy to build something meaningful?”

Not:

> “What did he do in 2022?”

---

# 7️⃣ The Core Identity You Should Lean Into

You’re:

* Senior engineer
* AI-focused
* Building a real product
* Thinking long-term

So lean into:

> Calm intelligence.
> Systems thinking.
> Product clarity.
> Anti-hype AI.

That’s rare. That stands out.

---

# 8️⃣ If You Want It Even Sharper

You can structure it like:

```
/ (Philosophy)
/kue (Product vision)
/notes (Thinking)
/beliefs (Convictions)
/now (Current focus)
/contact (Minimal)
```

Nothing else.

No clutter.
